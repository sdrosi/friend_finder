Welcome to Hipster Friend Finder!

It's kind of like a dating app, but way better.

The app uses html, bootstrap, node.js, Javascripy, JQuery, express, body-parser, and path.

To use:

- Click `Take Survey!`
- Complete the survey and click `submit`
- The app will then add your responses to an array, compare those responses to the individuals already in the database, and then  prompt a Modal that will give you your best response

This app was created in April 2018 while completing the UC San Diego Extension Coding Bootcamp.

Enjoy!
